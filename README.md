# SPACE BATTLE SIMULATOR 

## State management and event handling in React

simple interactive turn-based 🎰 space battle simulator where each fire ☄️ affects the health ❤️‍🩹 of both the player's and the enemy's spacecraft. 
The simulator will track the health points of both parties, dynamically updating after each attack based on random damage values. Additionally, the simulator is responsible for determining the battle's outcome—win, lose, or draw—based on the remaining health points. Moreover, when the battle ends, a restart feature will be available to initiate another round of interstellar combat.
